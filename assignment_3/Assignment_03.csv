0,Quality made and a fantastic deal!  Let me show you how they work., These Rockbirds LED Flashlights I bought came it a pack of 2 for only $9.99 which is a crazy good deal.  I collect LED flashlights and have about 30 right now but I really like these smaller ones because I can just keep them in my pocket.These are heavy duty and made with aluminum.  The battery compartment has an O ring to keep moisture out.  They are waterproof but not to be submerged in water but they will withstand rain.The beam is adjustable and you can see that in the video I provided to go with this review and I also show all 3 modes of lighting.  All you need to do is slightly tap the on and off switch and it will change modes.Please watch the video to get a better idea of what I am talking about.  Overall it is excellent for the price and you get 2!  I give this 5 stars easily.  I hoped this helped in some way.,5,GardenGuy,2017-03-04
1,"Miniature in size & price, but big on light output!","Given my many prior, poor experiences with several of the low-price/knockoff CREE type LED, zoomable style flashlights I've bought of this design, these lights are a surprisingly good purchase.  I've left off 1 of the 5 stars for 2 main reasons detailed in PRO's/CON's list below:CONS:1- Without (very) fresh batteries, the luminosity quoted in the product description isn't consistently provided by these lights- except on full, fresh batteries, the light is much dimmer than it can be when the light has fully powered batteries in it, so you'll end up going through batteries faster than normal (thankfully, the ""Amazon Basics"" AA batteries are very good quality & are very cheap compared to name-brands, so this is a solveable issue, just wasteful, seeing as you end up tossing batteries which still hold some charge- I've ended up using the 1/2 dead flashlight batteries in my cable box remotes in an effort not to waste them).2- Like many of the economical flashlights being sold of this design type, sometimes the power-button press to cycle between modes happens without your input, turning on the strobe setting or the lower light output setting without my intending to do so by pressing the power button.PROS:1- These lights are very compact, yet with fully charged batteries, they have a high light output for their size. Given the amount of light they provide when fully powered, they do a good job to the point that my wife always keeps one in her purse & her car for being about at night &/or walking our dog after dark.2- Unlike many of the other flashlights I've bought of this design/type, these lights have held up quality-wise over a decent amount of use- working just as they well as they did when they'd 1st arrived.3- The price asked would be inexpensive for 1 CREE-type LED light of this design & high quality, so very good value for a 2 pack!Overall I certainly recommend them if you're looking for a good, low-cost & compact CREE-type LED, zoomable flashlight which works well & is of good quality..",4,NSB,2018-02-10
2,Great for the kids while Camping,"Even though, the wide angle gives a decent spray of light. With a fresh battery, these lights struggled to light the bushes from 50 yards away. That does not mean if you want to use these babies in the attic, while checking the rat traps, you wont have great light, but when you zoom the lens for a tighter Beam... you'll find a ""square"" which is emitted by the LED module/crystal. Which is okay, (for kids) but not great if you need to really see that ""thing"" that is right there... LOOKIN BACK AT YOU ......  All in all, this is great deal for a four pack of flashlights that you can give to the kids for a camping trip, to keep them all on the same wave, but if you're looking for something else to keep you out of the dark, and give yourself a chance to stay ahead of the critters... try something else.",3,Snax,2017-11-07
3,Heavy Duty and Bright, These are good quality tactical flashlights. They have three modes and in the video I am posting along with this review you can see the difference in the 3 modes which are changeable with a click of the button at the end of the flashlight. There is a sturdy pocket clip mounted to the side of the flashlights with two small screws. So far I haven't had any problems with the flashlights which seem to be pretty durable and are just what I expected.,5,jack,2017-03-07
4,"Small, but mighty","These ended up being very handy, but I didn't realize how small they would be. To be fair to the manufacturer I probably didn't grasp what the dimensions they posted really meant so it's in. I way their fault. For those of you who are not as found of math or lack basic sense of  spatial awareness (like me), these little guys are about palm size. Maybe a little smaller or bigger depending on your body proportions, but that's my best comparison out the gate.All that being said these are some nifty flashlights. They have a bright, medium, and strobe setting which you change by halfway pressing the power button. I found that out a bit of a startling way, but was none the less impressed. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.",4,JTL,2017-09-13
5,small but powerful,"These are small enough to carry in a purse or backpack. I personally carry one in my purse for those times when I am going to my car late in the evening and need a light to see.  I take evening classes and sometimes going to my car is a little scary, so I really like having the flashlight readily available. It eases my stress and fears waking to my car being able to actually see.  We recently lost power and I used my rockbird flashlight most of the evening. I was amazed at how long and well it worked. I am very happy with these flashlights and look forward to using them for camping and hiking over the summer. I am impressed for as small as they are, they emit quite a bit of light.",5,Darlene Sharpe,2017-03-16
6,"One Bright, One Dim!",Handy little flashlights and I thought the clip would be great for for those times I don't happen to have pockets.  So far I found that the metal bar is so tight that I can't it to clip on any clothing and I am afraid to pry it open too far in case it snaps off.I also received one that was great and one that was significantly dimmer.  Can't blame the batteries as I switched them out with the same results.If they were both the same intensity I would rate them 5 stars.,4,Nalo,2017-08-25
7,Great Flashlights in a small package,Don't be fooled by their small appearance they pack a punch! Liked the fact that two came in a package. They are small enough that I kept one in my glove box in my car and one in the bathroom vanity in our upstairs bathroom.  When the electricity goes out it always seems like I can never find the flashlights now I have them on every level of my home. With one simple Double A battery they are ready to go.  They really give off a lot of light for a small flashlight.  I also like the fact that they have a setting that is like a strobe light.  That is why I decided to keep one in the car if we ever get stuck in the dark it can be used to flag someone down. I will be purchasing more of these!,5,Minnchic,2017-04-07
8,"one worked, one didnt","i gave it 3 stars because only one of the flash lights worked.  it didnt seem worth it to send them back since i really only needed one for a Christmas gift, just seemed easier and cheaper to get the two pack.  I put the batteries in and one worked right away while the other only pretends to work if the spring touches the side wall while the battery is in it and that's impossible to use since you have to close the cap to keep the battery inside.  The one that works however is awesome and more than what i expected it to be, flashes, zooms and expands and is very bright for its small size. just wish the other one worked. overall happy with the one that works but disappointed only one worked",3,Olivia,2017-12-11
9,"Fantastic Little Flashlight, Except...","Really love these little flashlights, they're the best I've found on market. Small, VERY powerful for their size, focusable and only require one AA battery.Why not 5 stars? Because of the three modes that you must cycle through every time. I have a couple of flashlights that stay in the same mode unless you repeatedly press the button, and then stay in that mode until changed again. That's the way all of these should work. It's a real pain to have to click so many times, just to get back to the only setting I'll use: high. Make that change and I'll buy a dozen for everyone in the family.",4,The Great Buzzwami,2017-04-30
10,Not happy with modes!!!!,I ordered similar lights to this in the past... LOVED THEM!  These however constantly cycle the features each time you turn the light on.For example:First time you turn it on... Super bright.Next time... Dim mode.Next time... Flashing pattern.NORMALLY... These types of flashlights should function:Momentary press button = Changes mode.Turn unit off = Remembers where it was.,2,BillyBobBooooooJohnson,2017-12-10
12,One for the price of two,"Opened the box, grabbed one of the flashlights, twisted the top off, placed the battery.  Seemed to work pretty good.  Then, I grabbed the other flashlight, twisted the... twisted the stuck top, pull the top, WD40 the top, twist the top while holding the body with pliers, threw in trash.  The top was welded on and stripped so badly there was nothing I could do to open it and place the battery.  If you're going to seal it shut, at least provide the battery.  Ridiculous.",1,JJ,2017-08-29
13,love these mini flashlights,Great deal for a pair of mini flashlights.  Very small and lightweight so very easy to throw in your purse to have just in case or around the house if the power goes out.  Fits in the palm of my hand.  Takes just one double AA battery.  Very bright and you can adjust to turn it even brighter.  Pictures I've taken below are in pitch black so you see how bright they are.,5,paintednightsky,2017-04-27
14,Very durable flashlights,These flashlights work really well. The are heavy duty metal so they feel like they will take some abuse and not break. They get very bright which is obviously what you want from a flashlight. You get 2 so its a good value for your money. I keep one in the car for emergencies and my husband has the other one. I think these will last a very long time.,5,Kelly,2017-04-06
15,"Not great, but worth the price.","These flashlights aren't as bright as I expected, but they work. I don't really like how each press of the power button cycles through the three settings (bright, dim, flashing). When I press the power, I expect it to always start on the bright setting, but it doesn't. It goes to whatever setting was next in the rotation. It's not a big deal, but it's a little annoying.I would give these 3 stars, but the good price point bumps it up to 4. I didn't pay much for these, so they're mostly worth the price. I have another small flashlight I much prefer, but it was also a lot more expensive.",4,Kris,2017-08-29
16,These flashlights are not actually 300lumens. They are not ...,"These flashlights are not actually 300lumens. They are not even 200 lumens. When compared to other 300 lumen and a 200 lumen flashlight I found that with new batteries at its highest setting folly zoomed in, was still visibly dimmer than the 200 lumen flashlight. I bought the two pack, and compared both to each other with both new alkaline and fully charged nickle-cadmium rechargeable batteries and found that they do not even match each other in brightness. They're inexpensive, and were the compact size I was looking for, but it seems you get what you pay for, and in this case you pay for under 200 lumens.",2,Matthew,2017-06-30
17,"Bright, well made. But wait for a sale to buy them.","Very well made aluminium tube and very bright. What more could you want? Well, maybe a bigger flashlight. These things are tiny but crank an amazing amount of light given their size. Good for car, purse or pocket. Or to clip on your belt. The ability to focus the beam from narrow to wide is a plus. Be sure to wait for the sales. Prices are all over the map on these things, from as little as $8 (for 2) to almost $30. A good deal at the lower price point.",4,DaytonaDan,2017-04-25
18,and the illumination is great for the size,"These are very small flashlights. They feel very solid though, and the illumination is great for the size. They easily clip inside the pocket of a pair of jeans and feel very similar to a clipped folding knife in my pocket. The housing at the end of the light slides in and out to adjust the beam, and there is a strobe setting on the light when you press the power button off and on again. Two lights come in the package. At first it seemed a little spendy for them when looking at their size, but as I have used it, and had it in my pocket, these are 20 times the light you get at a dollar store, or by spending less somewhere else. I bought 3 packs of 2. They have held up under the abuse my son's and friends dish out so far. And, they are very compact.",5,Amazon Customer,2017-01-06
19,compact and practical,"I always like to keep a small flashlight in my handbag in case of emergencies- you never know when an elevator will have a power outage or when you'll get stuck outside after dark. These are perfect for that purpose- they're lightweight enough yet comfortable to hold. I like that it comes in a pack of two, so I have a backup. The clip allows me to attach it to the pocket in my handbag for easy retrieval. And for a small flashlight, the LED light is strong, so I can see myself holding this for a long time in case of a power outage, unlike other powerful flashlights that are large, bulky and heavy.",5,electrolytz,2017-04-06
20,These work wonderfully well!,"We often need to head outdoors with no prior warning to deal with issues with the farm animals.  A bright, reliable flashlight that can slip into a pocket is a must for us.Shipping was fast with Amazon Prime and the packaging was excellent.  These flashlights did not come with batteries, but I had some on hand for the flashlights we already own.These flashlights are lightweight and very, very bright.  The adjustable beam allows us to search the woods quickly and then to pinpoint what we're searching for.  Most recently that was a wild raccoon who was tipping our waste cans and stealing food from the barn cats.The clips are strong, enabling us to ensure that the flashlights won't fall out of our pockets while we're working.I have absolutely no complaints and intend to buy these again!",5,WI Farm Family,2017-05-07
21,"Great light, rechargeable battery friendly","These are very lightweight and last forever on a single AA battery.I use them for evening strolls around (an increasingly dark as winter is upon us) set of streets and the flash mode make me very obvious to oncoming cars.Super lightweight, and built to last. I have been using them for months without an issue. They even work well with rechargeable batteries.One caution: Rechargeable batteries + LED's mean that when the power drops below the minimum the LEDs need, you will find that the light just stops working, unlike a bulb which dies slowly, this can cut off entirely. But keep a good charge and you won't be disappointed.",5,Mike M,2017-12-06
22,"Seemed high quality, power/selector button is flawed","These seem solid and good quality. However after using for one camping trip (right out of the box) the power button/mode selector on the flashlight has developed a short. It is indecisive on whether or not it will turn on at all when clicked, and the half click to change modes guarantees it shuts off and you're hard pressed to get it to turn back on again. I should have been thorough about putting these through the paces during the return window before trying to rely on them.",1,Bacon fan,2017-09-15
23,Best damn little 5 buck flashlight for EDC I like ...,"Best damn little 5 buck flashlight for EDC I like the nuts that are on the outside holding the clip on, several other types I've had used screws but screws require very small driver to tighten, these any pliers and your good to go again, the light with 1 AA gives almost as much as the NEBO Ihave that requires 3 AAAs strobe and multiple intensity beams all work very well. My only critique would be for a slightly less stiff clip it definitely stays on but requires an assist to clip on, or take out of pocket",5,Amazon Customer,2017-07-04
24,Great lights for a great price.,"These mini LED flashlights are perfect for my little ones to use while we are out camping. They are heavy duty yet light and water resistant so they can withstand the rain (it always rains while camping). With these you have the ability to focus and adjust the intensity of light. There are 3 different modes: high beam, low beam and flashing and it only takes one AA battery. My son loves the handy built-in clip; he can clip the flashlight to his pant pocket, on his shirt or where ever it fancies him. Only flaw to me is that the clip is quite stiff so it can be difficult trying to clip it on but it definitely stays in place. Overall, these are great, sturdy little lights for the money. You get alot of light from such a small flashlight.",5,FunMa of 3,2017-07-11
25,Absolute Garbage,I bought these  flashlights to keep in the glove box of both cars to use in case of an emergency.  They both failed only after using them several times.  The product is garbage and i threw both of them away.  Not even worth the hassle of packaging them back up to send back.  You get what you pay for I guess.,1,tj&mw67,2017-08-14
27,Looks can be deceiving,"At first I was going to give it 1 star....Upon opening my package, I see this tiny box. No way that's 1 flashlight, let alone 2. I open the tiny box and see 2 tiny flashlights. Great, I got ripped off. I put in a battery to try one out just for the hell of it. Was I wrong.....these tiny things are sweet. They pack as much light power as a bigger flashlight I have, which looks similar. These are great for BOB or EDC equipment. I might even buy a couple more.",5,Jago,2017-07-08
28,Delighted with this 6-pack of small,"Delighted with this 6-pack of small, VERY bright flashlights.Only minor quibble is that it's unclear when pressing the ""On"" button will turn on a solid light, versus turning on a rapidly-flashing light.(Apparently the flashing light - which may or may not come on - is to confuse all those terrible criminals that are trying to attack you ... 'cause, you know, you're so likely to face that ""tactical"" situation.)Other quibblette is that it'd be nice to be able to remove the pocket-clip (but it's attached with 2 unusual screws). On the other hand, if it was removed, then the flashlight would roll freely on any surface on which one might lay it - which would NOT be ""desirable"".  So, at least the pocket-clip keeps the otherwise completely round flashlight from rolling when layed-down.All in all, I LIKE 'em - a LOT!  :-)",5,Jim Warren,2017-09-26
29,"Great for the price, but not for your “main” light","Considering how little it costs for two of them, they are well built and very bright.  The issue is with the switch logic.  There is a single switch that turns it on/off (hard press) and changes the mode (half press).  The problem is that each time you turn it on, it switches to the next mode.  So if you are using it in “high” and turn it off, you will get “strobe” next time.  Not a deal breaker, but annoying.Again, great buy to throw in a drawer, but look elsewhere for something to carry every day.",4,Drew,2018-02-06
30,"Good, solid, small flashlights - great for camping","Great little flashlights for camping/hiking.  I kept one in my backpack for any emergency that might arise while hiking.  And the other in the car to use at my campsites.  I used the campsite flashlight EVERY night - it's small enough to comfortable fit in your pocket and bright enough to walk the dog and/or walk to the bathroom in near complete darkness and only had to replace the battery once.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to always rotate into strobe mode when I would turn it on - a little irritating, but not a deal breaker.",5,Leslie Jensen,2017-11-19
31,ONLY ONE WORKS LIKE IT SHOULD...,only one of the two i received works correctly.  one of them does the hi and lo and strobe.  the other one shines a light only.  china...,1,The End,2017-07-06
32,Outstanding buy for the price,"After a power outage, I decided we needed more flashlights available. The cheap 9 LED flashlights just didn't cut it and it was a lot of trouble having to insert three batteries into the flashlight cartridge. I have only tried out one Rockbird but the results were good. It isn't the most powerful flashlight around but it does the job. It puts out plenty of light and inserting one AA battery is very easy. For general use, it is a very good flashlight. My only con is that it is black and hard to find in the dark and in dark drawers. Wish I was able to get them in silver.",5,Able Devildog,2017-08-28
33,Very small but VERY bright I LOVE them!!!!,I love this set of 2 mini but very powerful flashlights I keep 1 in my purse and 1 in the drawer of my nightstand next to my bed for an emergency if the power ever goes out during a storm.  You can pull the top part up and down to make the light wider or smaller to fit the amount of light you need.  It also has a flashing light on it as well.  You can even clip the light to your pants belt clip that is on it. The LED bright light is perfect for helping you find your keys in the dark and also when walking at night time.  I will be getting me another set so my kids can have 1 for them to keep in they backpacks.,5,Mary H,2017-05-30
34,Crap!,Pure crap! They end up in garbage can two days after arrival. Very low quality.,1,Luis Rodriguez,2017-10-05
35,Rockbirds LED flashlight.,"Always, always need flashlights in our house and only LED ones.  The flashlight is bright, has a belt clip, fits perfectly in your hand and compact.  It has a caution mode, where the light blinks to let others know something is wrong. HOpefully no one will ever have to use that setting.  This flashlight being so compact is great for you need to look under cabinets and small spaces.  My husband used it for the lower compartment on his boat.",5,Darlene,2017-03-30
36,BE AWARE--NO RETURN,"I ordered these last week and after putting a battery in the first one thought it seemed like a good product, especially liking the small size.  I tried putting a battery in the second one and it will not close.  Apparently the grooves are stripped so it will not hold the end which secures the battery.  I tried to return and today discovered they are NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN so I have one flashlight instead of two.  I am wondering how long this one will last.",1,Sandi,2017-09-02
37,"Super bright, compact and a great value","I didn't expect that the mini flashlights would be as powerful as they are. They're great to keep in your toolbox, glovebox or purse. Also great to keep in a kitchen drawer for power outages, just in case.At just over 3.5"" long they emit a super strong beam of LED light. They are really solid and have a nice weight to them. Two AA batteries (not included) is all it takes to operate them both. I'm going to keep one in the car and use one for camping.Since they're water-resistant I can bring it out on the kayak for those evening paddles and I won't have to worry about the flashlight getting splashed.",5,GC Gallagher,2017-04-10
38,A nice LED (small) flashlight!,"I purchased the LED Flashlight by Rockbirds because I wanted a flashlight I could easily put into the center console of my Jeep. This flashlight is perfect because it is small enough to fit just about anywhere that you want to put a flashlight. You could carry this in your purse, your vehicle, it even has a clip for a belt. Just remember, batteries are not included. So you will need two AA batteries. I am pleased with this purchase. :-)",5,Kristi Fahlsing,2017-03-05
39,Nice and Compact,"I ordered these because of their size. They fit nicely and discreetly into my purse and I can take it to go in case I need it.These flashlights are nice and bright, perfect for emergency situations or power outages. I don't like having huge bulky flashlights in my tiny apartment. They really take up way too much space. These are well built, strong and will last a long time. Really happy to have found these.",5,Shieldmaiden Mist,2017-04-15
40,Two nice sturdy LED flashlights,I ordered my Rockbird led Flashlight thinking i was getting one. I am so surprised at the fact I recieved two. These by the way came so fast by prime. They didnt come with batteries so i loaded them today. Woot hoo. they are bright exactly what I aspected with LED. Nice and small fit so comfortly in my hand as a women the are about the size of my palm. I am totally keeping one of these in my kitchen and one in my SUV. Totally never know when its needed. Has a screw off top to change batteries as well as a nice sturdy clip to hold onto stuff. These Rock! Thank you again for the great Deal.,5,MS.Dimas,2017-04-04
41,Do Not Buy!!!!  Very Poor Quality & short lifespan!,"What a waste of money! These things looked like they'd be great, and I liked the adjustability of the beam angle. But they both stopped working within 1 week of being used. I've had lower quality cheaper crap from the dollar store last longer than these! I only rated them 1 star because there isnt an option for ZERO stars or even negative stars!",1,Cane Corso,2017-12-22
45,"Well-made, bright, and good deal.","Wow.  Nicely made.  Work very well with Li Ion 14500 batteries as well as with AA alkaline (of course dimmer).  Not hard to get used to the (stupid) inclusion of Strobe Mode.  They automatically cycle from mode to mode each time you turn them off/on with the tail switch.  Hint to make your life easier (such as it is): When (not if) it turns on automatically (every third time) in strobe mode, just gently push down slightly once or twice on the switch to make it cycle between modes to get what you want.  Instead of ""jumping up and down, screaming and shouting"", just think ZEN thoughts (Ooooommmm.  All is beauty) and gently depress the switch.And think of the amazingness of this: A bright (and cheap and well-made) LED flashlight that operates on one lousy battery at 1 1/2 volts (yes, even cheap light ""heavy duty"" non-alkalines) or an NiMH rechargeable at 1.35 volts and yet is still not destroyed by 3.7 volt Li Ion's.  Would I be as enthusiastic if I'd not got them on sale at 6.99?  Well, maybe a little less because the competition in quantity goes for about $3 to $4 per, and if I buy 5 or 6, I'd be giving away a few to friends and that would be even more fun.One little nit-picky thing: the ""Two Fluorescent Rings Which Shine in the Dark Night"" (not fluorescent but phosphorescent) the ""rings"" seem to be just those (cheap) little silicone rubber bands sold in handi-craft stores that are woven together (mainly by younger people, it seems) to make rings and bracelets.  Yeah, some of those are sold as glow-in-the-dark.  My point is that after a few minutes in the dark, I've seen matches brighter than these -yeah UNLIT matches!One more thing - if you use 14500 Li Ion batteries: EBL 14500 Li-ion Rechargeable Batteries 3.7V 800mAh for LED Flashlight Torch, 8 Packs most of these are what is called ""unprotected"".  In this case, it means if their voltage goes down in the flashlight, they are probably going to be damaged and may never again be able to be charged to full capacity - or at all.  So this is my suggestion: if the ""bulb"" starts dimming or shuts off by itself: immediately open the flashlight and take out the battery.  That way the flashlight cannot draw down its voltage any more.  Since there's no circuit to protect your battery, you have to do it.  This should help you protect your investment and continue to give you the nice bright light these batteries give with these flashlights.",5,James G. Demian,2018-04-10
48,Great little flashlights,This set of two flashlights are a great deal in my opinion.  I gave my husband one to use in his tow truck and one stays in the house for me. These flashlights are very bright and you can adjust the scope of the light from a large area to a precise close area. I use my flashlight in the house to check on eggs in an incubator so I pull the top of the flashlight out to narrow the scope. It is plenty bright for me to see the babies in the eggs. My husband has used his for lots of things in the tow truck. It is great for lots of jobs since it has adjustable lighting. It's also easy for him to keep on himself with the metal clip and non-slip grip.  I like that they are made with aluminium so they are lightweight and durable. So far they show no wear and tear even though we are constantly using them.,5,Erin Stubbs,2017-03-10
49,"Obnoxious strobe/flashing mode you can't avoid, but decent flashlight.","FYI, to get it to switch modes, you turn it of then on again and it switches.  It goes from (1) bright --> (2) Dimmer --> (3) Flashing.The flashing is obnoxious.  I wish I could get rid of that.  I see no need for that in my life or 99% of anyone who buys this thing.  It just threatens you with a seizure as you try to quickly switch it off and on to a different mode.But the light is fairly bright.  No big complaints with how it works when it's just on and working.",4,Trogdor,2018-04-08
50,Small but bright,"Very bright, well made, I like that it only uses one battery.  Small enough to fit in my pocket.  I use it for dog walks at night.  It lights up the ground very well and has a decent light projection for being so some.  It was a very good buy.",5,Zero,2017-08-19
51,Great Little Flashlights,Totally worth the price. Much brighter than the LED flashlights you buy at the checkout counter for the same price and this needs just 1aa battery rather than 3aaa like the checkout counter models.  These are tiny -FYI.  They fit in your palm so don't expect something bigger.  Great little lights.  I bought 2 just to check them out. Now I'll order the six pack and stash them all over.Just ordered 4 more. They arrived and work great.,5,Greg D.,2017-07-06
52,Piece of Crap - Don't Buy,"I wasn't able to open one of them to insert a battery.  Very poor design with the battery portal being combined with a light adjustment feature at the top.  It just turns and turns as though the battery portal is stripped. What a piece a crap!! It was a waste of time trying to open it and an even bigger waste of money!! In addition, the strobe function should work off an exterior switch that can be activated when the light is on. Not when you turn it off and then turn it back on only to have a useless strobe function activated.

53,"Besides metal casing, lower quality than Harbor Freight $2 LED flashlights","So I was hoping for a durable metal flashlight that had better than average candle power. What I got was essentially a $3 flashlight with a metal casing.First impressions were it was alittle lighter than I imagined.The light was not even that bright. I dug out a $1.99 Harbor Freight LED flashlight and compared the 2 on my basement wall. The H Freight one out shined the Rockbird one easily. Not terrible enough to junk or return, a small metal casing flashlight could come in handy.But when I need a bright light, I wont be reaching for this",2,Cogito ErgOsUm,2017-10-06
55,I am very happy I purchased the Rockbirds LED Flashlights,"I am very happy I purchased the Rockbirds LED Flashlights.  They are the perfect size for your purse, pocket, fanny pack or to store in the door of your car.  They are easy to use and very bright. They come in a pack of two. I put one in my Jeep and the other in my husbands truck.  I have used mine every time I have come home at night and needed to light my way to the door.  I highly recommend these flashlights.",5,Kindle Customer,2017-03-20
56,Small but powerful flashlight.,I bought these for my son and his friend to take camping on a school trip. They came in really handy because they got caught in the rain while hiking at night and these worked the entire time (almost one hour) until they got back to their campsite. They are small enough to fit in his jacket pocket so he was the only one to have one with him beside the counselor. We have them in a drawer in our kitchen in case the building loses power and it does all summer so they will come in handy. They are very bright and I would not expect that from such a small flashlight.,5,MsT,2017-05-12
57,Very practical product.,I'm really glad I got these.  I keep one in the kitchen (for finding equipment in all the dark corners of cabinets) and one next to the attic door (I'm afraid I use the attic as kind of an extended storage closet).  They're very bright and I particularly like the ability to broaden or narrow the beam.  They're generally all-around handy for those of us with poor vision who need an extra boost of light at times.  They're also great for finding a pet that's hiding from you because it doesn't want it's medicine.,5,J. B. Dian,2017-09-20
58,im shocked,"it is a bright,durable and cheap little light perfect for camping and the like.  i even used as an ice hammer when i forgot to close the lid on my ice chest and the top layer froze solid.  still works btw",5,Charles P. Mcalpin,2017-08-24

The other would not zoom/focus light the description stated it could 🤦🏻‍♂️ Very disappointing to say the least,1,George Morales,2017-07-26
65,Surprising!,"The switch button on the end operates easily, but not so easily as to come on when, say, searching for my keys and being dead the next day.I like the single AA battery.I like the compact size. It's bright for its size-and this goes to the one thing I disliked: one photo shows this lite brightly illuminating both sides of a sidewalk. This doesn't quite do that. That overstatement is what gets this 4 stars instead of 5 from me. I got over that quickly. Ounce for ounce, this unit pulls its weight.",4,James R Anderson,2017-11-24
66,Great range for a small package,We were looking for a decent flashlight for outdoor use - primary in the back yard to spot the pets or other critters.  I took a shot at these since they were on sale. They arrived and we kinda laughed thinking they wouldn't do the job.We were wrong.  Our back yard goes back 80 feet or so.  This thing lights it up in spot mode or the more open mode.  It's great.  I'll be picking up a couple more.,5,Gene H.,2018-04-11
67,Good on batteries,"These came in handy during Hurricane Irma. We live in Orlando, we lost power around midnight. These got us through that night. We eventually had to leave our home, No power for 7 days.But these little suckers were Very illuminating, Good on batteries, small but mighty. I bought one for each of my kids. It kept them entertained as the storm passed over us. We were able to play board games & cards games all night with these as our light.",5,Suki,2018-03-28

70,Bright and perfect size,This set of two flashlights is a great deal. I bought these so I would have one for my purse and an extra around the house. They are super small and compact but brighter than most flashlights. Small and only takes up about as much room as some lip glosses.I love that it only takes one AA to function. These flashlights are great to keep around.,5,sh,2017-05-28

73,I really like that you can pin point the light as well,These are much brighter than I thought they would be. Its a must if you live in back in the woods. They will be used for alot more than taking the pups out at night. I really like that you can pin point the light as well. Makes for trying to seeing certain things much better. What is great about this is I get one and my husband gets one. Great purchase.,5,jmbillet,2017-04-08
74,"Small, Bright, Durable Flashlight","I liked these so well that I gave them out as stocking stuffers to out family. They're built well, look nice, are plenty bright and small enough to have on hand or carry wherever you go. If you need a great little, durable flashlight, you can't go wrong with these. Highly recommended for sportsman and women of all activities, kids and folks in general looking for a small, bright, portable flashlight.",5,Jeff Dreyfous,2018-02-11

77,A Golden Pair of Mini Flashlights - YOU HAVE TO CHECK THESE OUT!!!,"I absolutely LOVE these mini flashlights. They illuminate so much more than one might expect from a device this size and fit cozily in your pocket, in a desk organizer, etc. You never know when you're going to need to light up under your bed, behind a large appliance or the sidewalk out to your garbage cans early in the morning. The monetary trade off is ridiculous with regards to what you get for your hard earned cash. They rest comfortably in the palm of your hand with intuitive motions to light up. Only thing I can't for the life of me figure out is why there's a strobe setting,  but that's just me maybe needing a clue as to a real world application. That said, I am in no way affiliated with this company nor do I foresee any financial compensation for a glowing review. I would have been stoked receiving just one of these flashlights but getting two? i say see for yourself, you won't be disappointed!!",5,Martoman,2018-04-08
78,Great but be Careful of Quality!,"I'd gotten these previously and it was time to get a few more.I was happy with the initial batch but while they're intelligently designed, the quality of the last batch I got wasn't great. 2 of the 4 didn't function properly. Though I will say the price is pretty exceptional.",3,Johnny S.,2017-09-17
79,Nice Little Light - Good Value,"For the money - these are very good little flashlights.  Slightly bulky to carry in a pants pocket.  Easy to carry in a purse, pack, coat pocket, or car.  I use these with the mini butterball 14500 batteries.  The total cost for the flashlights, batteries, and charger is about $20 for two.  I like the strobe mode for use as an emergency signal.  My only ""beef"" with the flashlight industry in general is the black color.  Seriously?  The point of a flashlight is to improve visibility in the darkness.  Try finding a jet black flashlight during a power outage!  Flashlights should be neon yellow or orange.  I don't care what they look like.  I want something I can easily find and use.  Please stop making black colored flashlights or provide options.",4,Robert,2017-10-08
81,Great value,"This is a small compact flashlight with a bright light, I have found it to be handy for lots of little things and big ones like flipping the fuse box. The only downside is I hate the strobe light because it hurts my eyes and you have to see the strobe in order to turn the flashlight off. The other downside is the flashlight has a lot of blue.",4,Harbinger of books,2018-03-30
82,Super bright little lights that work well.,"Super bright little flashlights. The focus on them is fun, but usually not very necessary. They seem like they can handle a pretty good beating. I carry one on my belt at work as it is compact, lightweight, and it comes in really handy. The only complaint I have is I wish the belt clip was heavier; I snagged it on my bench the other day while I was working and bent it all up. I took off the clip (held on by two small allen screws) and applied some love with a pair of pliers and it works great again. I don't know if anyone else would have this problem and it's easy to fix, so it's not worth taking off a star. I may make a heavier clip for it myself though.Overall, they do what I expect them to do.",5,DBK_Cali,2017-03-11
83,Better than I was expecting for the price and super ...,Better than I was expecting for the price and super bright for how tiny they are. If you put a good AA battery in them you will be stoked. I like that the light can focus in on small spaces. Good for exploring tight spaces. I would imagine they would be good in the mechanic industry. I mostly bought them for walking at night so people dont run me over. And for going into tunnels and sewage drains to look for clowns and stuff.,4,Nicholas Kisling,2018-04-06
84,Perfect!,These guys are perfect. I love their little size. And even though small they provide so much light. I love that I can spotlight or shine a large area. I am very satisfied and would order another one of these packs anytime!,5,Ronnie945,2017-11-20
85,Smaller than they look,"They are quite bright and seem to be solidly constructed, but the picture made them seem a bit larger than they really are. They can only hold one AA battery, so if you're expecting the larger kind with the caddy that holds three AAA batteries, you will be a bit disappointed. That said, even as small as they are, the price is very good.",4,Däch,2018-04-08
86,Bright little flashlights!!,"Great little flashlights! When we got them, we put the AA batteries in ( 1 per light) and they worked perfectly! When you click the button the light come on bright, click it again, and it's a different brightness, click it a 3rd time, and it strobes! They even have a little clip on it for a belt or a backpack! When you turn the front edge if it, the ""circle"" of light gets larger and smaller... this will be perfect for camping!!",5,Ronda Reigada,2017-04-15
87,"Tough, bright, compact and inexpensive, what more could one want?","The preformance and quality of these little flashlights is amazing.  I haven't used one long enough to expend the single AA cell but the amount of light they put out from 1.5 volts defies belief.  The color temperature is higher (bluer) than I would like for longer duration use, their small size makes up for that in convenience and their billet aluminum housing is as rugged as more expensive competitors",5,Robert Wenaas,2017-10-23
88,One of mine had a bad switch.,"They aren't bad lights, Really bright, lightly depress the switch and release to change the operating mode, I Just happened to get one with a bad switch, It pops loudly, occasionally doesn't work or won't turn off.

89,Five Stars,Great little flashlights.,5,KBOWDRUMS,2018-03-10
90,Amazing!!!!,"I received this light couple days ago. I was actually amazed how bright it is. Blindingly so. Focuses from beam to spot. I'm using it with a 2000 mAh NiMH AA battery. It seems to be made of pretty resilient materials. The strobe mode was an added plus not mentioned in the specs. I plan to use the light as a backup signal device for night walk. I was so impressed, I just ordered 2 more for my family. Highly recommends!!!!",5,Sandy Chen,2017-05-22
92,Dangerous,"One worked fine but the other heated up to an unsafe temperature, hot enough we removed the battery and disposed of it. If we had left it much longer it could have been seriously bad news.",1,Josh Hollingsworth,2017-08-14
93,Great EDC light,"These were purchased as gifts.  Both recipients are very happy with the lights.  These are being used as Every Day Carry (EDC) tools.  These have been in daily carry/use for three months with no complaints.  Very bright, work great, good battery life and a variable beam at a great price....what is not to like?Remember...it is not a Streamlight, SureFire, Fenix, etc....but it works, and it's 5$.  Worth every penny!",5,Mars24,2017-03-09
94,Good but TINY,"These are extremely tiny, they fit in the palm of my tiny lady hands but they are powerful and work great....I just want people to know because the picture can be deceiving.  I would still recommend these as I use them alot.",4,Mar Quise,2017-10-03
95,"The others are fine, but disappointing to have one be defective","One of the four flashlights doesn't work.  The others are fine, but disappointing to have one be defective.  Actually,a second one has stopped working.  I am going to see if I can contact the seller.",1,Rosalie,2017-09-04

97,These are great little flashlights for the price,"Nice sized, bright flashlights. They have 3 settings - bright, dim and strobe, and you can adjust the lens so it either floods or is very narrow. You really can't beat them for the price, and the form factor is great for throwing one in a drawer, one in your truck, etc.Also running on only 1 AA battery is nice! Battery is not included though.",4,the eliminator,2017-09-22
98,Good could be better,"So far these seem like good solid lights I would compare them to the ""csi"" nebo lights the only thing I would like better is if you could make then only bright mode and not have to cycle the switch 3 times through dim and strobe to get to bright again",4,RimRock,2017-05-22
99,"Faulty, low quality",Price is too good to be true. Don’t expect them to last. One of mine just died and the other only flashes?!?! It’s been 2 months so I can’t return. Not happy! Good luck!,1,Chip Johnson,2018-02-17
100,Perfect size for dusk dog walking,"I bought these in lightening deal not entirely realizing the compact size (my husband is a flashlight fanatic).

Keep one in the car in case you break down. They have that neat flashing feature to warn other motorists. Take one with you while you are out walking or while you are out with your pets.

Only downside is that I didn't think they were very bright, but the boys love them.",5,Kami Christian,2017-05-23
111,Uses focused beam rather than bright LEDs,"These RockBirds 7W LED Mini Tactical flashlights are not that bright (but many LEDs flashlights are really too bright for most uses).

116,Good working flashlights.,"I used this type of flashlights before (they are rather generic), and these also perform as well or better than many brand name units.

Disappointed to find out one flashlight doesn't work out of the box brand new. Would've given five stars based on the value. Not an extremely bright light but better than average considering price.

These led flashlights from rockbirds are the perfect choice for my family. They are small and very sturdy. Strong and very bright. There are what I would call 3 different modes of light. The first is a regular flashlight beam. This light is very bright and shows a long distance from the user. Next is a more.focused beam just pull on the flashlight and you get a smaller more focused beam of light in a square. Next is a flashing mode. I like this one best because I will take the dogs for a walk in the morning before it is light out and I can use this in flashing mode attach it to my jacket so that drivers can see me.Overall I have been very impressed with the quality of this flashlight.

956,Works great and even survived a hand washing submerged in water,"Works great and even survived a hand washing submerged in water.My personal gripes would be when you focus the light it looks like a logo instead of a generic beam and between the different flashlights the ""logo"" isn't even placed at the same consistent angle. And I wish there was a option on the side to toggle modes instead of hitting the power. If you turn it off and on you will have bright light, dimmer light, and the strobe mode and it's somewhat annoying when you're trying to just use a damn flashlight and have to turn it off and on just to get the right light or at least not turn on in strobe mode. Minor stuff and I can't think of a multi-mode LED flashlight that isn't setup like that, but I sure with someone would set them up that way.",4,Michael Cardone,2018-01-12

IDK yet if they've responded; I don't manage this account. my wife's account and I'm the occasional buyer. that said, looking at the order history, there's no clear Amazon indication that any adjustments have been made.lastly, seems one can reasonably expect a hit & miss scenario with these -- notice the irregular pricing, strongly nudging a buyer toward a larger collection. to whit -- we bought a 2-pack for $9.99; now i see both that same 2-pack but also a 4-pack for $12.99.caveat emptor",2,Unshine,2017-05-20

1082,Not rugged. Not even a little...,"I got this in June of this year.  After less than four months, it's broken.  Something is rattling around inside, it won't zoom in all the way any more, and there are two rubber band like things that (I'm guessing) used to be inside the flashlight and are very likely related to why it isn't working any more.  My work backpack has a pocket on the shoulder strap. It had been in that pocket for maybe a month before I discovered it had broken.This flashlight is not rugged. Not even a little.  If clipping it on an office worker's backpack for a month breaks something... Well let's just say I'm glad I didn't get into a situation where I was relying on this light. Very glad.Oh, and nothing at all on this product offering about warranty, how to return it, etc.  Honestly, I wouldn't accept a replacement. Only a refund.One other and less important gripe: The pocket clip is way too rigid and is really hard to get on anything.  That's why I put it on the pocket on my backpack shoulder strap. I couldn't even get the clip over the edge of my jeans pocket without using a tool to pry it open.Move on...get something else. Anything.  A glow stick would be better and last longer.",1,DenverDawg,2017-10-24
1084,Initial Quality Issues,"One of the flashlights worked great right out of the box. The second light had an issue with the focusing collar. Extending the collar took a greater amount of effort over the first one and it snapped back upon releasing it. If there's an o-ring inside, it's too snug and is creating vacuum on extension. It doesn't snap back all the way leaving about one-eighth inch gap. The only way I could retract it all the way was by rotating the collar as I pressed down and as I pulled up. Eventually I could fully extend it and retract it with no issues. The same flashlight had a short issue with the switch. One day upon pressing the on-off button it flashed on momentarily then remained off. Pushing down on the button had no effect and the switch would not lock in position. It wouldn't even rotate to the next position. I Removed the switch portion from the main body and tapped it on a table and tried pressing again. No change. I eventually screwed the switch back figuring that it was broken. After screwing it back on I tried  pushing the button one last time. It worked again! Probably some debris inside the switch worked free. I was going to ask the seller for a new switch as the problem could occur again at some inconvenient future time.",4,dudetoml,2017-09-01
1085,"They do the job, but be realiztic","Yes, just ok.  Runs on a single AA battery.  Ok light in a pinch.  We're not talking about a zillion lumens, by any stretch.  But, click the button, the light goes on.  Simple three mode mechanism.  Adjustable bezel, push/pull, to adjust beam size.  Flood setting looks best, but not the brighest.  Worth the buy, in case of an emergency. Besides, AA batteries are cheaper than dirt, and so easy to find.",3,Larry Maleszewski,2017-05-14

1107,Bright little lights. Good buy.,"Great little lights. The only two downsides are that the clip is tempered and will break if you try to bend it a little more so it's easier to clip on your pocket. The other is that when you turn it off, and then back on it goes to the next mode. So if you turn it off on the bright setting and turn it turn it back on, it'll be on the low setting. The modes are bright, low, & strobe. So I just switch it to strobe before I turn it off, that way it comes on bright. Not a deal breaker for me. But for some it might be.",4,Wolf Barber,2017-04-27
1112,Disappointed,"Delivery and packaging was great but the item is poor quality, cheap feeling although it has a metal body.  When screwing on the cap to battery compartment the metal sheered on the threads.  I do not imagine it will be very long lasting.  The light is good, though the pinpoint beam, I expected, would be more spot focused, it is still a fairly wide beam",1,yyz222,2017-05-20
1114,Ehh...Cheap,"They're cheap, but you knew that already. They're definitely not streamlight flashlights, but I mean, for the kids to have in their pocket while we're camping, who cares. They put off a square light. They squareness dissipates some as you zoom it. If you want a cheap couple lights for the kids, grab these.

1120,... a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light,After a long time of carrying these disappointments I am glad to say I can buy a new flash light. They are okay for throw away flash lights but they are very undependable and aren't really worth keeping for more than a week. I run a small business that requires me to constantly use a flash light and I bought these as a test run. After about a week they started going in and out. I replaced the batteries and still it only worked about 45% of the time. I'm not a picky person but these had a pretty bad short in their switch so I just kept them in a drawer and used them intermittently. Glad to say though they are finally dead as a door nail and I can replace them with something a lot better.,2,Seth,2018-01-18
1122,Very Dim and Disappointing.,"Incredibly dim. The rubber on the button is warped and bubbled. I found metal shavings in the threading of the battery chamber.

1139,Great lighting,"I purchased these flashlights to add to my bug out bag that I carry in my car. They're small, good quality, and only require 1 AA battery. It has a zoom in/out feature that is very handy. I also like that the power on and off button is at the end of the flashlight for quick access, whereas some other lights I've purchased have them on the side. My husband is using one for when he takes the dogs out to use the restroom at our apt complex and likes it.",5,Rosa Mendoza,2017-05-27
1141,Solidly made,"Very solidly made. Very bright and the beam is easily changed from concentrated to broad by sliding the lens. Runs on one AA battery which is easy to change. The LED is easily changed as well if needed. There were two in the package. The main problem is that there are three modes: bright, dim and bright strobe and you need to cycle thru all of them to get to the one you want. Every time you turn it on. It does not stay on the last mode used.",4,Steelman,2017-09-27

The lens is also quite thick because I also drop them on a concrete floor and not even a slight scratch. I ended up using them periodically over a time span of 7 hours in below 26° F weather and haven’t notice them go dim. Would recommend them because of the great value!",4,Mike Holmes,2017-12-26

1166,Toggle switch doesn't work,"Ordered 2 packages - 4 flashlights total.  One of the push button toggle switches works only when it feels like it - and it's not often it feels like it.  The other 3 flashlights work okay, but I wonder how long before their push button toggle switch craps out.This is the first time in 14 years of shopping with Amazon that a product we purchased doesn't work.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.It's not worth the hassle to send a $4 flashlight back. It should be thrown away, but then I'm throwing away $4 of my money.  It's not the money, it's the principle.  Come on Amazon, just suck it up and mail me a working replacement.",2,S. G. Shoemake,2017-04-23

I always used the strobe because it is more conspicuous and drains the battery less than a steady beam, and is legal for a bike headlight in Florida. At first I was very happy with the brightness, but after 2-3wks. the light would require many clicks of the switch to turn on. Then it would go dark during my trip, and afterwards it wouldn't come on at all. This started after a total use of less than 3hrs. in strobe function, and the battery still had plenty of charge. I tried the 2nd light, and had a similar experience. Not wanting to continue risking my life, I tried to return the item, but it was not eligable. I am very dis-satisfied.",1,Carol C.,2018-01-03
